# Risk Ledger Backend Code Exercise

Thank you for applying to Risk Ledger ðŸŽ‰.


## Existing Code

We understand completing a take-home technical exercise can be quite an ask, particularly if you are still in your current role, have personal commitments or are applying for multiple companies at once.

In lieu of completing the exercise below, we also accept other works, this could be contributions to open source or internal projects (you have permission to share).

We do however ask that:

* what you submit is solely by you, or has significant contributions from you,
* we can verify this, i.e. with commit history,
* and it still meets our [What We're Looking For](#what-were-looking-for) criteria below.


## Code Exercise

If you don't have any existing code you can show us, we've put together a code exercise for you to complete in your own time.

We'd like you to build a prototype networked service that crawls all internal pages linked from a URL to generate a list of linked URLs. The API of this service should be asynchronous, a caller should be able to request a URL is crawled, and check the results later without being blocked.

You may design any API, and use any structure or framework you feel comfortable with.

Please include a README detailing how we can run your submission, the trade-offs you made, and how you'd improve on your submission.


### What We're Looking For

**We value quality over completeness.** What we are trying to assess is your thought process and approach to problem solving. It is okay to leave something aside as long as you call it out in your README.

**We'd like to see testing,** and if you run out of time, we'd like to see code that is testable, and documentation in your README for how you would test your submission if given more time.

**Security is important.** If you don't address potential security issues in your submission, please document what they might be and how you would fix them if given more time.

We use [Go](https://golang.org) internally, however we'd prefer you use whatever language you feel strongest in, rather than use this exercise as an opportunity to learn Go.

We ask you don't spend more than **four hours** on this exercise.


### How To Submit

You may submit your code to us either on a hosted platform, i.e. GitHub or BitBucket, or as an archive file over email.
